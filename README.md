# Classification-Projects

## Earthquake Classification:

Used KNN and Decision Trees to build a classifier for predicting "magnitude" of an earthquake given longitude, latitude, depth, location and time info.

## CIFAR-10 Classification:

Used SVM classifier to classify CIFAR-10 dataset. (CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class )

## MNIST Classification using Logistic Regression:

Implemented Logistic Regression from scratch and used it to classify MNIST dataset.

## MNIST Classification using CNN:

Classified MNIST dataset using MLP and CNN.
